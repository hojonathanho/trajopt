Critical
=========

setcontactdistance screws you up if you have multiple collision cost groups
self-collisions in continuous collision cost

Eventually
===========

boost python arguments

optimization shouldn't say converged when it got worse

voxel grid collision checking. or at least preprocess voxel grid data.

TrajArray/DblMatrix/MatrixXd mean the same thing

PECost is PE^2

play with merit_coeff ratio and other optimization params
enable constraint scaling on all constraints

analytic derivative for pose constraint.

Figure out some consistent scheme for specifiying timestep of costs.

velocity cost uses timestamps
make optimization parameters settable

make a function specifically for self-collision testing. or configure collision checker somehow.

Maybe
=======

error message for unrecognized arguments from json

Partition links into groups and do broadphase filtering (?)
Do some smarter self-collision filtering, e.g. with custom code for each robot.
No need to do all the hulls every time you load up the robot.

Modifying bttransformaabb is a bad hack. figure out a better way.

collisionchecker segfaults if bullet world isn't updated
