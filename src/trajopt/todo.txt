Critical
=========


setcontactdistance screws you up if you have multiple collision cost groups

Eventually
===========

boost python arguments

optimization shouldn't say converged when it got worse

voxel grid collision checking

TrajArray and DblMatrix mean the same thing

PECost is PE^2

merit_coeff ratio and other optimization params
constraint scaling

Figure out some consistent scheme for specifiying timestep of costs.

velocity cost uses timestamps
make optimization parameters settable

Issue: now the collision checker will fail to find grazing self-collisions, since right now the continuous check
doesn't look at robot-robot collisions.

make a function specifically for self-collision testing

Maybe
=======

error message for unrecognized arguments from json

Partition links into groups and do broadphase filtering (?)
Do some smarter self-collision filtering, e.g. with custom code for each robot.
No need to do all the hulls every time you load up the robot.

Modifying bttransformaabb is a bad hack. figure out a better way.

make it easier to print stuff out for debugging optimization

collisionchecker segfaults if bullet world isn't updated
