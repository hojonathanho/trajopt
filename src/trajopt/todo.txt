Critical
=========

problem in convexdecomp: we don't check to see if new point is ok in some direction
bug when using "active" as manip (?)

cloud_drive_reach.py--error
can't start at non-origin position? (cloud drive reach)

setcontactdistance screws you up if you have multiple collision cost groups

unify logging. probably replace ipi stuff. remove ipi namespaces?

Eventually
===========

PECost is PE^2

merit_coeff ratio and other optimization params
constraint scaling

Figure out some consistent scheme for specifiying timestep of costs.

Run automated tests with python examples
(Can't do it now because of segfaults on exit)

velocity cost uses timestamps
make optimization parameters settable

Issue: now the collision checker will fail to find grazing self-collisions, since right now the continuous check
doesn't look at robot-robot collisions.

make a function specifically for self-collision testing

Maybe
=======

error message for unrecognized arguments

Partition links into groups and do broadphase filtering (?)
Do some smarter self-collision filtering, e.g. with custom code for each robot.
No need to do all the hulls every time you load up the robot.

Modifying bttransformaabb is a bad hack. figure out a better way.

make it easier to print stuff out for debugging optimization

collisionchecker segfaults if bullet world isn't updated
